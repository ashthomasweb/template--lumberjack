If you haven't used NodeMailer before, don't worry, even though you will be editing some things on the back-end of the
site it's straight-forward, and that's what version control is for anyway. You are using it right? LumberJack ships
setup to automatically send 2 emails through SMTP, one to the person in charge of inquirys for your business, and one
confirmation email to the person who made the request. You can send as many emails out per each request as you want,
however, if you are sending more than 2 you will need to make some small changes in the "/app.js" file as well as the
"/nodemailer.js" file. If you are sticking with the two automatic emails, one to you, one to the client, then all you
need to do is open up "/nodemailer.js". In the "Mailer transport object" you will need to supply your own email host
information. Nodemailer works well with google OAuth as long as your host allows for external SMTP email services. In
the "Templates" section, you will find the two templates currently in use and a commented out template you can use as an
example to generate more emails. You will find detailed instruction in the appropriate places in the code file.

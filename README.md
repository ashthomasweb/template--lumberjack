## General info
This template is great for a local business taking their products or services to the web. Artisans, influencers, and private businesses need a way to integrate social media, ongoing public interest, and a strong brand sense. LumberJack provides a quick setup for even a beginner front-end dev. You will need to find hosting and edit some code files, but if you can follow directions and are willing to learn something new along the way LumberJack is accesible to any developer. If you already have brand images, colors, copy, and social accounts, you can expect to have the site fully running and styled in one day. If you are starting from scratch and need to generate images, copy, accounts, and a brand sense, expect 1 - 2 weeks for full deployment.

## Documentation
LumberJack's setup documentation can be found on the LumberJack Blog. Head to (https://www.lumberjack.ashthomasweb.com/blog) to get started. You can find articles helping you setup NodeMailer, Prismic, Curator, and how to start integrating your brand content. You can find a text-only version in the documentation.

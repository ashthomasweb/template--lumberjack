## General info
This template is great for a local business taking their products or services to the web. Artisans and private businesses need a way to integrate social media, ongoing public interest, and a strong brand sense. LumberJack provides a quick setup for even a beginner front-end dev. If you already have brand images, colors, copy, and social accounts, you can expect to have the site fully running and styled in one day. If you are starting from scratch and need to generate images, copy, accounts, and a brand sense, expect 1 - 2 weeks for full deployment.

## Known Issues
* Instagram slider needs a js position helper function. Fast-clicking results in partial photo's being displayed.
* "Card" element's border radius has display errors allowing the background-color of the inner element to show through. FIXED
* event.path is not supported in Firefox, Edge, or IE. However, the main blog intro uses event.path to find parent elements and apply hover effect on mouseover of entire element.

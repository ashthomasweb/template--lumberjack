So you've setup Prismic, Curator, and Nodemailer, now what? You need to pick a host and get it up and running. Many
times, depending on the hoster, they can help migrate your site, or you can do it yourself if you know how. 

Each hoster
is going to be a little bit different. But no matter where you go, you will need to set your environment variables, and
don't upload the .env file in the root directory to your server. 

Once you have LumberJack successfully running live on
your server, it's time to bring it back to development, or put it on a development server, and get your content on the
site. 

LumberJack uses a color theme focusing around two brand colors and greyscale copy framing. I recommend picking two
contrasting colors that speak about your brand. From there, you need to generate three additional shades of color from
each brand color. The card layout depends on these shades being complimentary to each other. As you can see with the
default styling, there are several greens and several browns, all derived off of the "primary-color" and
"secondary-color". The names of the root variables in the "/public/css/theme.css" should help you pick shades. 

If you
have made it this far...you can make it the rest of the way. Pick some fonts, find a pattern for the body background,
and choose some artwork. Upload your logo and favicon, and get to placing content on your pages.

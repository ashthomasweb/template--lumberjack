Let's get you setup with Curator. Head on over to Curator.io and sign up for a new account. 

Once you are in your
dashboard, you will be asked to select the social media site you want to pull content from. Follow the prompts to pull
content from the appropriate channel or feed. 

Once you have, Curator calls it a "Source". When you pick your first
source it will automatically take you to the "Curate" tab, where you can decide which posts will be included in your
feed. 

Once satisfied with your choices, you have some styling options. 

If you are using Instagram, and want the Curator
feed to appear in the LumberJack style, you need to set the feed style in the following manner. The "Feed Style" needs
to be set to "Grid - Sydney". Under the "Feed" tab, end "1" in for "Rows", and "310" for "Min post width". 

That's it!
Click "Save", then "Publish Feed". A popup will appear, all you need to do is copy the line of code that starts with
"i.src = "https://cdn.curator.io.....". Copy that entire line and replace the corresponding line in your
"/views/public/partials/footer.ejs" file. 

If you renamed your default feed, you will also have to rename the appropriate
element id in "/public/media.ejs". Look for the **LumberJack Instruction** comment. 

If you are putting feeds other than
instagram on your site you will need to copy that feed code and make a second entry in your
"/views/public/partials/footer.ejs", and also place the feed HTML where you want the feed to appear.
